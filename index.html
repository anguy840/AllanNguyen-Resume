        Luxuriating in the satisfaction of food videos, it's a lifestyle. As a
viewer who continues to distinguish between effective marketing and
poor attention-grabbers, you can count on me for a full 180
perspective on any form of work. Looking towards managing
advertisements and garnering social media attention. I am adaptable,
morphing my views to the constant waves of trends crashing in. With
previous experience in creating a product concept for an
entrepreneurship club and marketing this idea to fellow members, I
can develop innovative ideas and balance my schedule. In the end,
digital-food becomes my brain-food.
<br><br>

        Customer service and satisfactory performance are always priorities of mine. I previously worked in two establishments in the food industry where I built and formed interpersonal relationships between myself and the customers. Great communication is always the key to outreaching and expanding oneâ€™s network of clientele. Throughout my experience, I trained six employees over the span of three months, conducted successful cash audits at the end of every shift, and efficiently managed the storeâ€™s opening and closing. I was interested in promoting the company and forming a more connected network of customers. I became an outreach intern at a non-profit company. Some of my responsibilities included constructing graphics to create new appeals in order to reach wider audiences and bringing new ideas to the table promoting company business efficiently new ideas to the table promoting company business efficiently and effectively. I wanted to pursue this interest outside of my career as well, specifically focusing on the betterment of my own community as a Vietnamese-American. As mental health and gambling are taboo subjects within the Vietnamese community, I had to approach the issue of combating both the stigma of problem gambling and the effects of addiction. After being enrolled in an alternative activities program that used arts and media to promote positive youth development and leadership in the summer of 2017, I discovered BOOF. BOOF, standing for Betting On Our Future, is a youth-led problem gambling awareness campaign. I was drawn to the group seeing it could fulfill my mission of helping relieve the counteractive effects of gambling addiction in the community.
During the past four years as a dedicated member of BOOF, I participated in media projects ranging from public service announcements to graphic campaigns spreading awareness about problem gambling. From storyboarding short films to reviewing marketing analytics, reaching a broader audience to prevent problem gambling entranced me into marketing community support. I co-wrote one short film, and two public service announcements, and scripted a radio public service announcement. Each year, we created a showcase inviting local community members to supply free entertainment, and food, and most of all present our projects and knowledge to the community. In hopes of maximizing my ability to shed light on problem gambling, Iâ€™m looking forward to engaging in the field of marketing and connecting with future classmates on community issues. With experience in community showcases, I hope to do the same on campus, being able to present information of different levels for students, staff, and communities outside of my own.
